## Driving Forces

- John Tukey identified 4 forces driving data analysis (there was no “data science” then):

1. The formal theories of math/stat 
1. Acceleration developments in computers and display devices 
1. The challenge, in many fields, of more and ever larger bodies of data 
1. The emphasis on quantification in an ever wider variety of disciplines 

## What questions can data science answer? 

- Specific
    1. How can we increase sales?
    1. Does the January campaign on product X increase the amount of purchase from our 2017 retained customers? 

- Data
    1. Representative
    1. Relevant
    1. Quality
