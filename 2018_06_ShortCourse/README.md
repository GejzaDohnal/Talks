# Preparing Statistician to be Successful Big Data Scientist

Outline/Description: With recent big data revolution, enterprises ranging from FORTUNE 500 to startups across the US are hungry for data scientists to bring valuable business insight from all the data collected. Statisticians are great data scientist candidates, but there are relatively few data scientists with statistics education background. In this short course, we will walk through the needed data science knowledge and skills through hands-on exercises to prepare statisticians to be successful data scientists. Data access and manipulation (i.e., extract-transform-load) in production environments are typical gaps for statisticians and these topics will also be covered in this course. Data science is a combination of science and art with data as the foundation. We will also cover the art part to guide participants to learn typical data science project flow, general pitfalls in data science projects, and soft skills to communicate with business stakeholders effectively. The Databricks community edition cloud platform and R-Studio will be used to cover programming and platform (such as Spark, Hadoop, GPU, SQL, and R) and typical machine learning algorithms (including examples for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning). The prerequisite knowledge is MS level education in statistics and entry level of R knowledge.
This is an enhanced version of a similar highly-rated and full-day training course (CE 11C) offered at JSM 2017 in Baltimore with updated material to reflect students suggestions and new trends in data science. 

1. Introduction to data science. In this section, we will introduce the history and trends in data science. We will list typical requirements for successful data scientist and do an evaluation for participants to find the skill gaps and give recommendations to bridge the gaps. Participants will have a good understanding of what data scientists do and know their skill and knowledge gaps after taking this section.

2. Big Data Cloud Platform. In this section, we will first introduce how to open Databricks community edition account to leverage its scalable cloud-based big data platform (i.e. a mini Hadoop/spark or GPU cluster with R, Python, SQL and Markdown capability). Nearly all the programming and demo related topics are based on this cloud platform. We will briefly introduce SQL and databases, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, Spark and GPU computing environment for high- performance computing with big data. Participants will be confident to work with these big data platforms after this section.

3. Data Science Project Cycle. In this section, we will leverage the Databricks platforms Spark capability with R to go through some important topics in the data science cycle. The platform provides a production-like environment at enterprises. Participants will be able to use R to leverage Spark to do those data manipulation after this section.

4. Survey of Typical Machine Learning Algorithms. In this section, we will leverage the Databricks platform to explore typical machine learning algorithms typically used in industries with hands-on examples. Participants will learn how to apply these algorithms in real world problems through big data platform after this section.

5. Soft Skills for Data Scientists. In this section, we will introduce the needed soft skills that are essential in data science projects at enterprise environments. We will talk about basic project management skills with agile concepts and how to effectively communicate with business partners to define and solve data science problems. We will illustrate how to lead with confidence given the strong technical background that statisticians have. Participants will be familiar with data science collaborations in enterprise environments after this section.
